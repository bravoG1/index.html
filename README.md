Hi 👋 My name is Bravog1
User Registration Form

A structured interface that typically collects essential information to identify and authenticate the user.

First section:

This is where the user fills in their personal information, from the name, date of birth, age, gender to the profile photo.

Second section:

This is where the individual fills in their contact information, Email address, phone number, website, street address, city, country, zip code and their preferred contact time.

Third section:

This is the preference and interest section.

The user fills in their favorite color, experience level, birth month, available week, interests, level of education and their password.

Forth section:

This is the feedback and additional information section and the user has to tell us about themselves, suggestions for improvement, registration time and date, how did they hear about the organization, upload their resume, subscribe to the newsletter, agree or not agree to terms and conditions and agree or not agree to the privacy policy.

Finally the user has the option to register or clear the form.

My file has a heading.

Four fieldsets each carrying its own content.

Register and clear form input types.

This is for:

Clarity: Makes it easier for you (and others) to understand the project at a glance.

Maintainability: Simplifies updates, debugging, and collaboration
